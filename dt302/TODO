The driver and the applications seem to work in its original version, but
there are a few things which need to be checked:

- backpropagation of some options to 2.4 to have consistent header file
- backport / fix some of the errors into 2.4 kernel
- document stuff
- separate header files from internal stuff, clean up header files
- fix loader scripts to make it compat with other loader scripts
