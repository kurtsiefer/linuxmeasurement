This is a unified driver/applications directory.

Drivers are contained in the OS-version specific directories (2.4 or 2.6),
and a few applications are in the apps directory. The devstuff holds a loader
script. 

How to make everything:
Say "make" in this directory, and it compiles driver, apps and a loader
script, which can be (as Su) installed via make install.

The loader script must be activated with a runlevel editor.



files in 2.4 directory:

dt302.c	   source code of the device driver.
dt302.h    header file containing all the definitions you need to
	   talk to the driver with ioctl() commands
dt302.o    the compiled driver; insert it with insmod; see below

files in the 2.6 directory:
dt302.c   source code
dt302.h   extended version of the header file; contains a few more
	  ioctls.

applications:

dacout_dt302:   small toy program to put an analog voltage onto one of 
                the two analog output ports.

readsinglechan_dt302:  small program to read in the value of one of
                       the eight analog differential inputs.
readallchannels_dt302: small program to read in all eight differential input
		       channels in one go.
oscilloscope:          program to acquire a longer set of data from several
		       channels with an adjustable timing down to 10 usec.
oscilloscope2:         advanced version of oscilloscope, can trigger on
		       a signal on one of the channels. 
streaming:             a simplified version of the oscilloscope programs
		       to read in a continuous stream of analog data.


dt302_counter:    program to count pulses for a given time
                  interval. see source code for usage.

history:
  modified pci_enable position to get correct PCI resources 5.9.07chk
  migrated DMA buffer allocation to kernel routine, fixed ioctl value
    retreival counter and old misaligned buffer version. 29.9.09 chk
  added oscilloscope programs 30.8.09chk
