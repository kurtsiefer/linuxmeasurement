   The code is basically taken from the dt340 driver.  Supplies
   a loadable kernel module for a 2.4 kernel, offering two minor devices.

   The most basic one is minor device 0, allowing simple read/write access
   to the complete address space of 64k offered by the card via ioctl calls as
   well as some driver-internal control registers. The minor device 1 is
   similar to minor device 0, but acquires also the interrrupt of the card.

   The driver also implements an interrupt handler which is able to both
   count interrupt events for the individual interrupt sources on the card,
   or notify the calling process with a SIGIO signal about an interrrupt
   occured. The behavior of the handler can be controlled via a count control
   register, a notify conrol register, and a last-pending-int register. With
   the latter, an application being signalled by the driver can determine
   what interrupt has caused the signal.

   minor device 0: For simple tests. Implements methods open, close and ioctl.
		   The open method returns a -EBUSY in case the device is in
		   use already. 
		   ioctl commands follow roughly the ideas in asm/ioctl.h:
		   Syntax is ioctl(handle,cmd,value), where cmd is an
		   unsigned long, with the lower 16 bits specifying the
		   address, and bitfield cmd[31:30] contains the direction of
		   the transfer: 0x1 means write to dt330, 0x0 indicates a read
		   access to a given address. For read access, no value has to
		   be supplied, and the register content is the return value
		   of the call. For write access, the unsigned long value
		   is written to the specified register. return value is 0 on
		   success.
		   Adresses have to be word-aligned, i.e., cmd[0:1]=0,
		   otherwise -1 is returned.
		   Read/write is always performed in longwords.
   minor device 1: same as minor 0, but with using the interrupt line (i.e., 
                   acquire it on opening ). The device also implements an
		   fasync method, allowing user notification with SIGIO upon
		   an occured input. For this device, the interrupt
		   handler registers make sense using. Access to them is also
		   achieved using the ioctl method; there are read- write and
		   read/write acesses possible using the bitfield [30:31] as
		   above. For Read/write access, the operation is guaranteed
		   not to be interrupted.
		   The registers are:
		     8 interrupt count registers, one for each possible irq
		       source. Adress range is 0x10000 to 0x10007. For example,
		       a read of interrupt count register 5 can be performed
		       with the command ioctl(handle, 0x80010005)
		     a count control register, address 0x10009. The bitfield
		       [0:19] determines which interrupts should increment the
		       irq count registers. The ordering in the bitfield
		       corresponds to the order in the interrupt pending
		       register at address 0x1000.
		     a notify control register at address 0x1000a. If a bit
		       in this register is set, the corresponding interrupt
		       can cause a SIGIO signal to be sent to the owner of
		       the open device. Therefore, the user has to install a
		       signal handler and activate the FASYNC mechanism using
		       the fcntl command.
		     a register on address 0x1000b containing the last iqr
		       pending register content. This allows to determine
		       which events caused the signal.
		   Note that activating the counting or notification does not
		   automatically enable the irqs on the card.

  The driver is alpha in the sense that the following options still should be
  implememented:

  - support for opening the device several times. It should be possible for
    independent processes to access different subunits, or for processes
    having "read only" access to registers, while only one is allowed to
    write in the device. Changes Therefore would affect the f_async structre,
    and would need a mechanism to declare the access needs of a process to
    allow for clever blocking techniques. An ioctl declaring the "greediness"
    (read_only, sharing, exclusive) of a process to the DIO or CT subsystem
    might work.
  - support for SMP machines. Currently, only little care was spent to avoid
    problems in these architectures.
  - check for other race conditions.
  - support for earlier kernels. Probably 2.2 and 2.0  compatibility is not
    hard to achieve, the irq handler uses bh mechanism, and devfs is not used.
    However, certainly some structure defs have to be changed.

    Thanks to Data Translation for their uncomplicated help with a hardware
    register description of the card.

    First working version:                Christian Kurtsiefer, Nov 12, 2002
                          christian.kurtsiefer@physik.uni-muenchen.de

   seems to work (I/O features and interrupts 
   tested on channel d)                              chk 12.11.02

   transition to 2.6 kernel, needs to be tested. updated pci_enable
       location 5.9.07chk
   updated SA_INTERRUPT and  SA_SHIRQ flags.          10.8.09chk
   updated ioctl to new unlocked version    22.6.11chk
